    reflection:
      'For years, companies asked for "managers" to enforce processes. Now, they need "leaders" who inspire growth. The key difference I\'ve seen? Empathy. In our last executive workshop, we saw a 40% increase in team-reported engagement after focusing solely on active listening and empathetic feedback. This is the new currency of the effective workplace.',

    reflection:
      'Many companies view their immigrant workforce through the lens of "challenge"â€”language barriers, cultural gaps. This is a mistake. The real lens is "opportunity." These individuals bring resilience, diverse perspectives, and a powerful drive. Our work proves that investing in targeted training and education isn\'t just a social good; it\'s a direct investment in your bottom line.',
